## THIS IS NOT THE OFFICIAL PKGBUILD

PKGBUILD for use on Arch by makepkg.
Built for simple install and updation of [ftxui](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI) library.

Just run makepkg in the directory, or see github.com/adig-pkgs/adig-pkgs how to add the custom repo to have it listed by your pacman.
